ML Pathways v1.0 – Agentic ML Problem Playground
Overview
ML Pathways is an interactive web-based platform inspired by Andrew Ng’s Foundations of Machine Learning. Users can explore core ML problems through a hands-on workflow: selecting an ML problem, choosing or uploading datasets, chatting with an agent for EDA and Q&A, generating code, and executing it safely—with all results visualized and explained. Perfect for learning, experimenting, and understanding data science step by step.

Core Features
ML Problem Menu: Users select from foundational ML tasks (see below).

Sample Datasets Library: For every problem type, agent presents a curated sample dataset—ideal for demos or exploration before uploading custom data.

Data Upload: Users can upload their own CSV datasets.

Automated EDA Dashboard: The agent creates interactive data summaries and visualizations.

Conversational Q&A: Users ask questions about data or ML approach; the agent responds and explains.

Suggestion Engine: Agent suggests solvable tasks for the dataset + chosen algorithm.

Python Code Generation & Explanation: The agent writes and demystifies the code, step by step.

Sandboxed Execution: Secure, remote code execution (e2b/Modal) with instant result feedback.

Graphical Outputs: Results, errors, and model metrics displayed as intuitive graphs.

Interpretation & Guidance: Agent helps users interpret results and refine their approach.

Supported ML Problems (from Andrew Ng’s Course)
Linear Regression with One Variable

Sample dataset: Predict housing prices by size.

Linear Regression with Multiple Variables (Multivariate)

Sample dataset: Predict housing prices by size, rooms, location, etc.

Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

Sample dataset: Predict admit/reject for university based on test scores.

Regularized Regression

Sample dataset: Predict prices or outcomes with feature overfitting.

Polynomial Regression

Sample dataset: Predict trends with nonlinear relationships (e.g., population growth).

Classification with Multi-class (One-vs-All)

Sample dataset: Classify handwritten digits (MNIST-style sample).

Neural Networks (Basic feedforward for Classification)

Sample dataset: Classify objects/images with simple neural networks.

Optional/Stretch:

K-means Clustering: Cluster exercise (e.g., customer segmentation).

Principal Component Analysis: Dimensionality reduction.

Security, Privacy, and Scalability
Containerized Execution: All code runs isolated using e2b/Modal.

Data Security: Strict access, branch isolation for user experiments, fast rollback.

Observability: Sentry captures all errors and exceptions for user safety.

API Security: Next.js Middleware efficiently controls rate limiting and endpoint protections.

Extensibility & Roadmap
Add additional models (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees, Ensemble methods) as new course modules.

Expand agent-powered community features (share datasets, collaborative Q&A).

Integrate advanced experiment tracking and leaderboard capabilities.

Success Metrics
Rate of user engagement and course completion.

Frequency/quality of questions asked via agent.

Reliability of sandbox code execution.

Learner progression and satisfaction.

ML Pathways v1.0 will help bridge theory and practical ML application, providing engaging, agent-powered learning and experimentation.
